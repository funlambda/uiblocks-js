# uiblocks-js

Represent complex UIs in a declarative way with UI Blocks!

This is an experimental library that allows users to build up UIs as a combination of state machines. Similar to Redux but a more opinionated abstraction that better supports reusable generic components, composability, and strong typing (via Flow annotations). Output of a uiblocks app is a single view model object that can be easily rendered with React.

I've abandoned this project and am working on a new version written in F# (compiled to JS via Fable), which will be released late 2016.
